# angularTestApp

# Overview
The goal of this assignment to to create a simple Angular application which updates a sortable list of items in real-time based on updates from a websocket. You are free to use any resources you find online but if you copy any code (even if it's modified), please add a comment with the source.

# Requirements
The application need only target Chrome, Firefox, or Safari and does not need to worry about backwards compatibility; if it runs in the latest version of your test browser it'll be sufficient. While you are free to use Angular 2.0, since we use 1.x in production, we've only provided boilerplate for a simple Angular 1.x app.

# Functionality
The application should create a table with 100 rows, with IDs from 0... 99. Each row should have three columns -- the ID, a numerical value, and a name. You should initialize the numerical value to the ID for that row and may choose any initial names that you like. The table should be sorted in descending order by the value in that row. You should feel free to use any scheme you'd like to organize files, etc but note that minifying the app and other steps to productionize are not within the scope of this assignment. You should feel free to polish the development experience or build pipeline if you wish but accomplishing the listed milestones is more important.

# Getting set up
You should only need to install the modules in the package.json file included via npm install to get started. You can run the server simply via node server.js and an example client is also provided which may be run in a similar fashion.

# Milestones
1. Application shows a static list with all items
2. Application updates the list based on websocket updates
3. Application is performant when NUM_ITEMS = 1000 and MESSAGES_PER_SECOND = 1000 (you'll want to tweak the app to have 1000 rows as well)
